Random Music

</h1><br>
<br><br>

Searches music library and creates a temporary playlist containing 300 random generated songs. <br> 
Starts the playback on your connected speakers. <br>
Just network mount your music to `/media/Music` and run the py,<br> 
it will take care of the installation process of VLC and modify the binaries so it can be run safely.<br><br>

And if you like the song playing, you can just say ["add this to my playlist"](https://github.com/pungkula1337anka/Voice-Stuff/blob/main/AddSongToPlaylist.md)     

<br><br><br>


- **1: Intent Script** <br>

If you dont have it already, create the file `intent_script.yaml` in the /config dir and fill in the code below.<br>
(dont forget to reference it in `configuration.yaml` with `intent_script: !include intent_script.yaml`<br> 

- **2: Custom Sentence** <br>

Create a folder called `custom_sentences` inside your /config dir.<br>
Inside that folder, once again create a folder named with your language code. `sv` for swedish, `en` for english.<br>
In that folder you create a file and name it whatever you want, but remember it, cause it will be referencesd later.<br>
I will use `IntentName.yaml` as an example here, fill this yaml file with the code from below. <br>

- **3: Shell command** <br>

Create a file called `shell_commands.yaml` in your `config` directory. <br>
Dont forget to include it in your `configuration.yaml` file. `shell_command: !include shell_commands.yaml` <br>

- **4: Python script** <br>

Create a file called `random_music.py` in your `config` directory. Paste in the code from below. <br>


<br><br>

You are done, try it out! <br><br>


## **‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è You can get a media player entity ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è** <br>

Settings > Devices & Integrations > VideoLAN > VLC with Telnet  
and fill in your local ip and default port.  
If you did not change the password in the pyscript, the password is `test123`.
