Play Playlist

</h1><br>
<br><br>

Makes sure VLC is installed, then starts playing a playlist. <br> 
Playback is started on your HA connected speakers. <br>
I use [this](https://github.com/pungkula1337anka/Voice-Stuff/blob/main/AddSongToPlaylist.md) to add songs to the playlist by voice. <br> 

<br><br><br>


- **1: Intent Script** <br>

If you dont have it already, create the file `intent_script.yaml` in the /config dir and fill in the code below.<br>
(dont forget to reference it in `configuration.yaml` with `intent_script: !include intent_script.yaml`<br> 

- **2: Custom Sentence** <br>

Create a folder called `custom_sentences` inside your /config dir.<br>
Inside that folder, once again create a folder named with your language code. `sv` for swedish, `en` for english.<br>
In that folder you create a file and name it whatever you want, but remember it, cause it will be referencesd later.<br>
I will use `IntentName.yaml` as an example here, fill this yaml file with the code from below. <br>

- **3: Shell command** <br>

Create a file called `shell_commands.yaml` in your `config` directory. <br>
Dont forget to include it in your `configuration.yaml` file. `shell_command: !include shell_commands.yaml` <br>

- **4: Python script** <br>

Create a file called `play_playlist.py` in your `config` directory. Paste in the code from below. <br>

## **‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è TO STOP THE PLAYBACK‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è** <br>


The terminal command `pkill vlc` will stop the music.<br><br>
For volume control, one option is to use<br>

mute
```
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN" -d '{"index": 0,"volume": 0}' http://supervisor/audio/volume/output
```

<br><br>

100%
```
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERVISOR_TOKEN" -d '{"index": 0,"volume": 1}' http://supervisor/audio/volume/output
```

    playlist_file = sys.argv[1]
