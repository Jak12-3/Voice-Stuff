Play Fuzzy Artist
</h1><br>
<br><br>
Searches /media/Music for chosen artist and creates an temporary playlist, starts playback on your connected speakers, after it shuffles all the songs in the playlist.<br><br>
The beuty about doing, whats called an "fuzzy search" like this, is that it allows you to (most likely) call an artists name which are not in your native language.<br> 
Even if the STT generates the wrong word, the python script will still point you to the right directory path.<br><br>
Just network mount your music to `/media/Music` and run the py,<br> 
it will take care of the installation process of VLC and modify the binaries so it can be run safely.  

And if you like the song playing, you can just say ["add this to my playlist"](https://github.com/pungkula1337anka/Voice-Stuff/blob/main/PyAddSongToPlaylist.md)

- **1: Create the shell commands.** <br>

Create the file 'shell_command.yaml' file in your /config dir and paste in the code below.
This will allow you to call the script easily later.

- **2: Intent Script** <br>

Create the file 'intent_script.yaml' file in the /config dir and fill in the code below.


- **3: Custom Sentence** <br>

Create a folder called `custom_sentences` inside your /config dir.
Inside that folder, once again create a folder named with your language code. `sv` for swedish, `en` for english.
In that folder you create a file called `PlayArtist.yaml` and fill in the code from below. 

- **4: The fuzzy search python script** <br>

This is where the magic happends. <br>
Within your /config dir, create a file called `play_fuzzy_artist.py` <br>
Paste in the code at the bottom of this page. <br>

<br>
Your all set, try it out!<br><br>
