Block Ads on iOS

</h1><br>
<br><br>

Annoying ads, large pictures you dont wanna see etc etc? <br>
Hold you finger on the ad/picture and press Copy, and say "Siri Blockera DNS". <br><br>

This is an IOS Shortcu, you can download it here [Block Ad](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e995e0defb444095958dffcbe72e7370)

_This assumes you have AdGuard or similiar to block dns with, this just makes the process of sending the urls quick and smooth._
