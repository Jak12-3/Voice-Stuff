# __🦆 👀 Few words__  <br>


<br>__🦆 👀__<br>

lost my vision almost 20 years ago. This is me, trying to make my life a little easier with voice assistants. <br>

simple voice control, and some stuff there between.<br>

<br>
it would be fun if any of this could help other visually impared people, but somehow i doubt any of those would ever end up here.   

guess i am okay, if this here would happen to help any regular, non blind, _(muggles)_ along the way too.

<br>

can be found at [discord](https://discordapp.com/users/675530282849533952)

<br><br>

i am looking for any __stupid__/smart/doable/impossible/__crazy__ ideas to expand the list below.<br>

after weeks on a dry streak of ideas, it would be sad if list got `finished`.<br><br> <br>
one million screen hours to secure an hour less screentime future<br>
<br>

<br><br>

## 💻 looking to copy pasta/Jinja? <br>

so you like copy pasta huh? well, maybe ....<br>
uploaded code are just examples and you might have to<br> 
edit some for it to work without issues. <br>
sharing is caring right? <br>
this is just so you get the general idea about intents,<br>
and proof that you **DO NOT** meed AI to control your assistants. <br>
all yoou need is black sun glasses, a white cane and a dog with keyboard skillz? woff woff<br> 
 <br>
be aware of the file structure so the right<br>
code goes into the right file.<br>
