## 💻 looking to inja?]<br>

so you like copy pasta huh? well, maybe ....<br>
uploaded code are just examples and you might have to<br> 
edit some for it to work without issues. <br>
sharing is caring right? <br>
this is just so you get the general idea about intents,<br>
and proof that you **DO NOT** meed AI to control your assistants. <br>
all yoou need is black sun glasses, a white cane and a dog with keyboard skillz? woff woff<br> 
 <br>
be aware of the file structure so the right<br>
code goes into the right file.<br>
